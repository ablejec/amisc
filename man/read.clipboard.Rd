\title{Read Clipboard}
\usage{
read.clipboard(header = T, sep = "\\t", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{header}{a logical value indicating whether the file contains the names of the variables as its first line. Defaults to \code{TRUE}. If missing, the value is determined from the file format: header is set to TRUE if and only if the first row contains one fewer field than the number of columns.}

\item{sep}{the field separator character (default \code{\\t}). Values on each line of the file are separated by this character. If sep = "" (the default for read.table) the separator is â€~white spaceâ€™, that is one or more spaces, tabs, newlines or carriage returns.}
}
\value{
A data frame. See \link{read.table}
}
\description{
Read text (usually table with data) from clipboard. This is a wrapper function for \code{read.table} with different defaults.
}
\details{
This function is useful for debugging where it can be useful to know
the name of the object associated with the displayed value.

The actual printout depends on option \code{getOption("amisc.testing")}.
If it is set to \code{FALSE} (default) nothing happens.
If set to  \code{options(amisc.testing = TRUE)} test output is produced.
}
\examples{
# Copy some data to clipboard before running the code below
